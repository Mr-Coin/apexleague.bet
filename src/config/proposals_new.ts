Prize pool: 37M $APX Yearly rewards paid from prize pool:\n   â—¦ 500k champ\n   â—¦ 250k 2nd\n   â—¦ 100k 3rd\n   â—¦ 100k last place\n\n3. Liquidity pool: 1M token allocation backed by $100 each from 12 members for a pool value of $1,200, valuing each token at $0.0012. Each team starts with 1M tokens, so your initial stack is worth $1,200 (1M Ã— $0.0012).\n\n4. Utility: Use $APX to sweeten player trades, side bets, buying waiver position, anything you want!",
